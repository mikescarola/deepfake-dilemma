## Security & Cyber Risks

While deepfake technology offers benefits, it also presents serious cybersecurity risks, including:
- **Misinformation & Political Manipulation**: Deepfakes are increasingly used to spread false information and disrupt democratic processes.
- **Identity Theft & Financial Fraud**: AI-generated deepfake voices and videos can impersonate individuals, leading to fraudulent activities.
- **Cyber Warfare & National Security Threats**: Intelligence agencies warn about the use of deepfakes in espionage and cyber warfare.

The need for robust detection and mitigation strategies is critical to counteract these threats.
