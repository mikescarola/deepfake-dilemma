## Detection & Countermeasures

To combat the misuse of deepfakes, several technological and policy-driven solutions are being explored:

### Detection Methods:
- **AI-Powered Detection Algorithms**: Vision Transformers (ViTs) and multimodal classifiers detect pixel inconsistencies.
- **Blockchain Authentication**: Secure tracking of media alterations to verify authenticity.
- **Watermarking & Metadata Analysis**: Embedding hidden markers in media files to confirm legitimacy.

### Policy & Education:
- **Regulations & Legal Frameworks**: Criminalizing malicious deepfake use.
- **Digital Literacy Campaigns**: Educating users to identify deepfake misinformation.
