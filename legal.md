## Legal & Ethical Issues

Deepfakes challenge existing legal frameworks in areas such as intellectual property, defamation, and consent laws.

### Key Legal Concerns:
- **Copyright & Ownership**: Legal ambiguities exist in determining the rightful owner of AI-generated content.
- **Defamation & Fraud**: Fake videos and audio can cause reputational damage or financial loss.
- **Privacy Violations**: Individuals appearing in deepfakes without consent raise serious ethical concerns.

Governments and organizations are working to establish clearer regulations to tackle these issues.
