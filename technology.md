## Technology Overview

Deepfake technology has grown rapidly, primarily through advancements in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and machine learning methods. These technologies allow for the creation of highly realistic synthetic media that can mimic human appearance and voice with uncanny accuracy.

### Key Technologies Behind Deepfakes
- **GANs**: The backbone of deepfake generation, enabling high-fidelity image and video synthesis.
- **Transformer-based models**: Used for improving natural language processing and voice replication.
- **Diffusion models**: Enhancing the realism of deepfake-generated content.

The increasing accessibility of deepfake creation tools presents both opportunities and risks. The ability to generate realistic AI-driven media necessitates better detection methods and policy measures to mitigate potential abuse.
